# Deposits & Withdrawals FAQ

Common questions about depositing and withdrawing funds.

## Deposits

### What's the minimum deposit?
**$10 USDT** is the minimum deposit amount.

### Is there a maximum deposit?
No maximum limit. Deposit as much as you want.

### Can I make multiple deposits?
Yes! Each deposit is tracked separately with its own 21-day lock.

### Do I need a referrer to deposit?
No, you can deposit without a referral code. However, connecting with a referrer can help you access team resources and support.

### How long do deposits take?
Usually **3-15 seconds** on BSC. Occasionally longer during network congestion.

### My deposit isn't showing - what do I do?
1. Check the transaction on BSCScan
2. Wait a few minutes and refresh
3. Ensure you're connected with the correct wallet
4. Contact support in Telegram if issue persists

### Can I deposit from an exchange?
Not recommended. Always withdraw to your own Web3 wallet first (MetaMask, Trust Wallet), then deposit from there.

## Lock Period

### What is the 21-day lock?
Your deposited capital is locked for 21 days. During this time, you can claim profits but cannot withdraw principal.

### Can I withdraw early?
**No.** Principal is locked for the full 21 days.

### What happens after 21 days?
Your deposit becomes withdrawable. You can:
- Withdraw everything
- Withdraw partially
- Leave it to keep earning

### Do my profits lock too?
**No.** Profits (ROI + referral commissions) are claimable anytime.

## Withdrawals

### How do I withdraw?
1. Connect wallet to imp.money
2. Check that your deposit is unlocked (21+ days)
3. Click "Withdraw"
4. Confirm in your wallet

### Are there withdrawal fees?
**No protocol fees.** Only BSC gas costs (~$0.20).

### How long do withdrawals take?
Usually **3-15 seconds**. Funds go directly to your wallet.

### Can I withdraw to a different wallet?
No, funds go to the wallet that made the deposit.

### What do I receive when withdrawing?
Your original deposit + any unclaimed profits.

### Can I partial withdraw?
Yes, after the 21-day lock you can withdraw any amount up to your full balance.

## Problems

### Transaction stuck/pending
- Check gas price isn't too low
- Wait 10-15 minutes
- If stuck, try "Speed Up" in MetaMask
- Or wait for it to fail and retry

### "Insufficient funds for gas"
- You need BNB for gas fees
- Transfer ~$2-5 BNB to your wallet

### "User rejected transaction"
- You declined in your wallet
- Try again and approve the transaction

### "Execution reverted"
- Transaction failed on-chain
- Common causes: insufficient balance, contract issue
- Check exact error on BSCScan
- Contact support if unclear

### Funds didn't arrive
1. Check transaction on BSCScan for success
2. Verify correct wallet is connected
3. Add USDT token to wallet if not visible
4. Wait and refresh dashboard
