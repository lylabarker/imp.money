# Referrals & Commissions FAQ

Common questions about the referral program.

## Getting Started

### How do I get a referral link?
1. Connect wallet at imp.money
2. Make at least one deposit
3. Go to Network & Referrals section
4. Copy your unique link

### Do I need to deposit to earn referrals?
Yes, you need at least one active deposit to be eligible for referral commissions.

### Can I deposit without a referrer?
Yes, but you'll be assigned to the protocol's default referrer and cannot change later.

## Commissions

### How much do I earn per referral?
It depends on their level from you:
- L1 (direct): 2%
- L2: 1.5%
- L3: 1.25%
- L4-L6: 1% each
- And so on (see [Commission Rates](../referrals/commission-rates.md))

### When do I get paid?
**Instantly.** The moment someone deposits, your commission goes directly to your wallet.

### What token are commissions paid in?
**USDT** - same as deposits.

### Is there a cap on commissions?
No cap. Earn unlimited referral income.

## Levels & Network

### What's the difference between "level" and "rank"?
- **Level**: Your position from a user (L1 = direct, L2 = their referrals, etc.)
- **Rank**: Leadership status (Star 1-5, Kings Star, Master King)

### How do I unlock all 21 levels?
Deposit $200+ and have 5 active direct referrals.

### What makes a referral "active"?
They have at least one deposit that hasn't been fully withdrawn.

### Can someone change their referrer?
No, referrer relationships are permanent once set.

## Tracking & Management

### How do I see my network?
Dashboard → Network & Referrals section shows:
- Direct referrals count
- Total network size
- Commissions earned
- Team activity

### Can I see my downline's deposits?
You can see totals and activity, but individual deposit amounts are private.

### Do referrals carry over if I withdraw?
Yes! Your network relationships are permanent, even if you withdraw temporarily.

## Troubleshooting

### I didn't receive my commission
1. Check the transaction on BSCScan
2. Verify you had an active deposit when they deposited
3. Confirm you had the required levels unlocked
4. Contact support if still missing

### My referral shows in my L2 but I referred them
This means they used someone else's link (who used yours), OR there was a technical issue. Contact support.

### Referral link isn't working
- Make sure it includes your full address
- Format: `https://imp.money?ref=0xYourAddress`
- Test in incognito browser
