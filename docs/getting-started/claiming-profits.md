## Claiming Strategies

### Strategy 1: Daily Claims

- Good for covering expenses
- More gas fees over time

### Strategy 2: Weekly Claims
- Claim once per week
- Balance of liquidity and efficiency
- ~7 days of profits per claim

### Strategy 3: Full Cycle Claims
- Wait 21 days
- Claim everything at once
- Most gas-efficient

### Strategy 4: Compound (Reinvest)
- Claim and re-deposit
- Grows your principal
- Maximizes long-term returns

## Compounding Example

Starting with $1,000 and reinvesting all profits after each 21-day cycle:

| Cycle | Principal | Cycle Profit | Total After |
|-------|-----------|--------------|-------------|
| 1 | $1,000 | $147 | $1,147 |
| 2 | $1,147 | $169 | $1,316 |
| 3 | $1,316 | $193 | $1,509 |
| 6 | $2,313 | $340 | $2,653 |
| 12 | $5,350 | $787 | $6,137 |
| 17 (1 year) | $9,450 | $1,389 | $10,839 |

## Gas Costs

- Each claim transaction costs ~$0.10-0.20 in BNB
- Batching claims is more gas-efficient
- Claims are processed in a single transaction

## FAQ

### Can I claim while my deposit is locked?
**Yes!** Profits are always claimable. Only your principal is locked for 21 days.

### Is there a minimum claim amount?
**No minimum**, but consider gas costs. Claiming $0.50 with $0.15 gas may not be optimal.

### How often should I claim?
Balance your cash flow needs with gas efficiency. Weekly is a good middle ground.

### Do unclaimed profits keep growing?
**Yes!** Profits continue to accrue whether you claim or not.
