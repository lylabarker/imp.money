# Making Your First Deposit

This guide walks you through depositing USDT into IMP Money to start earning 0.7% daily returns.

## Prerequisites

Before depositing, ensure you have:

- ✅ A connected wallet (see [Connect Wallet](connect-wallet.md))
- ✅ USDT on BNB Smart Chain (minimum $10)
- ✅ Small amount of BNB for gas (~$2)

## Step-by-Step Deposit

### 1. Navigate to Dashboard

Go to [imp.money](https://imp.money) and ensure your wallet is connected.

### 2. Enter Deposit Amount

- Minimum deposit: **$10 USDT**
- No maximum limit
- Enter the amount you wish to deposit

### 3. Add Referral Code (Optional)

If someone referred you, enter their referral code or wallet address. This:
- Links you to their network
- Gives them a commission on your deposit
- Does NOT reduce your earnings

{% hint style="info" %}
**No referrer?** You can deposit without one, but you'll miss out on potential team benefits if you later want to build a network.
{% endhint %}

### 4. Approve USDT

First transaction: **Approve** the smart contract to use your USDT.

1. Click "Approve USDT"
2. Confirm in your wallet
3. Wait for confirmation (~3-5 seconds on BSC)

### 5. Confirm Deposit

Second transaction: **Deposit** your USDT.

1. Click "Deposit"
2. Review the transaction details
3. Confirm in your wallet
4. Wait for confirmation

### 6. View Your Position

Once confirmed, you'll see:
- **Deposited Amount** - Your principal
- **Lock End Date** - 21 days from now
- **Daily ROI** - 0.7% of your deposit
- **Claimable** - Accumulated profits (updates daily)

## Understanding the 21-Day Lock

Your deposit is locked for 21 days. During this time:

| Action | Available? |
|--------|------------|
| Claim profits | ✅ Yes, anytime |
| Add more deposits | ✅ Yes |
| Withdraw principal | ❌ After 21 days |

After 21 days, you can:
- Withdraw everything (principal + remaining profits)
- OR leave it and continue earning

## Gas Fees

Typical transaction costs on BSC:

| Action | Approx. Cost |
|--------|--------------|
| Approve USDT | ~$0.10 |
| Deposit | ~$0.20 |
| Claim | ~$0.15 |
| Withdraw | ~$0.20 |

## What Happens to Your USDT?

1. **USDT enters the IMP Vault** smart contract
2. **Vault deploys to PancakeSwap V3** CLMM pools
3. **Concentrated liquidity** earns trading fees
4. **Protocol calculates your share** at 0.7% daily
5. **You claim profits** whenever you want

## Example

| Deposit | Daily Return | After 21 Days |
|---------|--------------|---------------|
| $100 | $0.70 | $14.70 profit |
| $500 | $3.50 | $73.50 profit |
| $1,000 | $7.00 | $147.00 profit |
| $5,000 | $35.00 | $735.00 profit |

## Important Notes

{% hint style="warning" %}
**Risk Disclosure**: DeFi protocols carry inherent risks including smart contract bugs, market volatility, and liquidity risks. Only deposit what you can afford to lose.
{% endhint %}

- Profits accrue from the moment of deposit
- You can make multiple deposits (each has its own 21-day lock)
- Referral commissions are paid instantly to referrers
