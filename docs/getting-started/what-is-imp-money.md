# What is IMP Money?

IMP Money (Internet Money Protocol) is a decentralized DeFi protocol on BNB Smart Chain that generates yield through automated liquidity provision on PancakeSwap V3.

## The Problem

Traditional DeFi yield farming is complex:
- Requires understanding of liquidity pools
- Manual management of positions
- High gas fees for rebalancing
- Impermanent loss risk
- Technical barriers for regular users

## The Solution

IMP Money simplifies everything:
- **One-click deposits** - Just deposit USDT
- **Automated management** - Protocol handles liquidity
- **Stablecoin focus** - Minimal impermanent loss
- **Daily returns** - Earn 0.7% daily on your deposit
- **Network rewards** - Build a team to multiply earnings

## How It Works

```
Your USDT → IMP Vault → PancakeSwap V3 CLMM → Trading Fees → 0.7% Daily
```

1. **You deposit USDT** into the IMP smart contract
2. **Protocol deploys** to concentrated liquidity pools (USDT/USDC)
3. **Trading fees** are generated from swap volume
4. **You earn 0.7%** daily on your deposited amount
5. **After 21 days** you can withdraw your capital
