# Withdrawing Capital

After your 21-day lock period, you can withdraw your deposited capital. This guide explains the process.

## Understanding the Lock Period

When you deposit USDT:

| Day | Action Available |
|-----|-----------------|
| Day 1-20 | Claim profits only |
| Day 21+ | Withdraw principal + profits |

## How to Withdraw

### Step 1: Verify Lock Ended

Check your dashboard for the lock status. It should show "Unlocked" or "Withdraw Available".

### Step 2: Navigate to Withdraw

On your dashboard, find the withdraw section.

### Step 3: Initiate Withdrawal

1. Click **"Withdraw"**
2. Enter the amount (or select "Max")
3. Review the transaction details
4. Confirm in your wallet

### Step 4: Receive Funds

Your USDT is sent directly to your wallet.

## Withdrawal Options

### Full Withdrawal
- Withdraw all principal + remaining profits
- Closes your position completely
- No more daily returns after this

### Partial Withdrawal
- Withdraw some of your principal
- Remaining amount continues earning
- Available after initial 21-day lock

## What You Receive

When you withdraw after 21 days:

| Component | Amount |
|-----------|--------|
| Original Deposit | 100% returned |
| Unclaimed Profits | Included automatically |
| **Total** | Principal + All Profits |

### Example
- Deposited: $1,000
- After 21 days: $147 profit accumulated
- Never claimed during the period
- **You receive: $1,147 USDT**

## Multiple Deposits

If you made multiple deposits, each has its own lock timer:

| Deposit | Amount | Lock Ends | Status |
|---------|--------|-----------|--------|
| #1 | $500 | Jan 1 | Unlocked ✅ |
| #2 | $300 | Jan 5 | Unlocked ✅ |
| #3 | $200 | Jan 15 | Locked 🔒 |

You can withdraw unlocked deposits while others remain locked.

Funds always go to the connected wallet that made the deposit.
