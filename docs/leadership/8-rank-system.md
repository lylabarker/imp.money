<figure><img src="../assets/images/leadership-ranks.png" alt="8 Rank System"><figcaption><p>Progress Through 8 Leadership Ranks - Up to 7.5% Bonus</p></figcaption></figure>

Beyond the 21-level referral commissions, top leaders earn additional bonuses on their entire downline's ROI claims - up to **100 levels deep**.

## The 8 Ranks

| Rank | Bonus | Team Size | Business Volume |
|------|-------|-----------|-----------------|
| 👤 Affiliate | 0% | - | - |
| ⭐ Star 1 | +1% | 100 members | $5,000 |
| ⭐⭐ Star 2 | +2% | 200 members | $10,000 |
| ⭐⭐⭐ Star 3 | +3% | 500 members | $25,000 |
| ⭐⭐⭐⭐ Star 4 | +4% | 750 members | $50,000 |
| ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ Star 5 | +5% | 1,000 members | $100,000 |
| 👑 King's Star | +7% | 2,500 members | $500,000 |
| 🏆 Master King | +0.5% extra | 10 King's Stars | Network-wide |

## How It Works

### Differential Bonus

You earn the **difference** between your rank and your downline's rank on their ROI claims.

**Example:**
- You are **Star 5** (5% bonus)
- Your downline is **Star 2** (2% bonus)
- When they claim $100 ROI, you earn **3%** = $3

### 100 Levels Deep

Unlike referral commissions (21 levels), leadership bonuses extend to **100 levels** deep!

This means:
- Build deep networks
- Earn on leaders you've never met
- True passive income potential
