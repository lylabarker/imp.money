# Differential ROI Bonus

The leadership bonus system uses a **differential model** - you earn the difference between your rank and your downline's rank.

## How Differential Works

Instead of earning a flat percentage, you earn based on rank difference:

```
Your Bonus = Your Rank% - Downline's Rank%
```

### Example

| You | Downline | Difference | You Earn |
|-----|----------|------------|----------|
| Star 5 (5%) | Unranked (0%) | 5% | 5% of their ROI |
| Star 5 (5%) | Star 2 (2%) | 3% | 3% of their ROI |
| Star 5 (5%) | Star 5 (5%) | 0% | Nothing |

## Why Differential?

### Rewards True Leadership
- You earn more when you develop new people
- Helps you focus on growing leaders

### Prevents Double-Counting
- Without differential, ranks would stack infinitely
- Protocol would be unsustainable

### Encourages Mentorship
- Better to have many Star 2s than one Star 5
- Wide teams beat deep teams

## Calculation Examples

### Scenario 1: New Team

You're Star 3 (3%). Your network claims ROI:

| Member | Their Rank | ROI Claimed | Your % | You Earn |
|--------|------------|-------------|--------|----------|
| User A | None | $100 | 3% | $3.00 |
| User B | None | $50 | 3% | $1.50 |
| User C | Star 1 | $200 | 2% | $4.00 |
| **Total** | | $350 | | **$8.50** |

### Scenario 2: Developed Team

You're Kings Star (7%). Same users advanced:

| Member | Their Rank | ROI Claimed | Your % | You Earn |
|--------|------------|-------------|--------|----------|
| User A | Star 3 | $100 | 4% | $4.00 |
| User B | Star 2 | $50 | 5% | $2.50 |
| User C | Star 5 | $200 | 2% | $4.00 |
| **Total** | | $350 | | **$10.50** |

Notice: Even with higher-ranked members, you still earn because you're higher.

### Scenario 3: Same Rank

You're Star 5 (5%). Your downline is also Star 5 (5%):

| Member | Their Rank | ROI Claimed | Your % | You Earn |
|--------|------------|-------------|--------|----------|
| User D | Star 5 | $500 | 0% | $0 |

No differential = no bonus. But their downline below still pays you if they're lower.

## Compressed Ranks

When someone at your level "breaks even" with you, look deeper:

```
You (Star 5)
  └─ Star 5 leader (no bonus FROM them)
       └─ Star 2 member (YOU earn 5% - 2% = 3%)
            └─ Unranked (YOU earn 5% - 0% = 5%)
```

You still earn from people below the equal-ranked leader!

## 100 Levels Deep

The differential bonus applies to **100 levels** of depth:

- Much deeper than 21-level referral commissions
- Find the next Kings Star 50 levels down? Still earn!
- True passive income from network you've never met

## Maximizing Differential Earnings

1. **Advance fast** - Higher rank = bigger differential
2. **Recruit beginners** - 0% rank = full differential
3. **Build wide** - More branches = more ROI claims
4. **Develop leaders** - Their teams add volume
