## How Rankings Work

Your contest score is based on **Direct Business** — the total value of deposits you and your direct referrals bring in during February.

```
YOUR SCORE = Your Own Deposits + Your Direct Referrals' Deposits
```

{% hint style="info" %}
**Direct Referrals Only** — Only deposits from people who used YOUR referral link count. Deposits from your sub-team (Level 2+) do NOT count toward contest rankings.
{% endhint %}

### Example

| Activity | Amount |
|----------|--------|
| Your deposit | $500 |
| Referral A deposits (direct) | $1,000 |
| Referral B deposits (direct) | $300 |
| **Your total score** | **$1,800** |

### What Counts ✅

- Your personal deposits during February
- Deposits from your **direct referrals** (Level 1 only)
- Fresh USDT deposits during February 1-28, 2026

### What Doesn't Count ❌

- Deposits made before February 1
- Deposits from Level 2+ (sub-team)
- Compounding (reinvesting earnings)
- Withdrawals

## Frequently Asked Questions

### How can offers exist in a decentralized system?

The **smart contract** is immutable and on-chain - it cannot be changed.

The **contest** is separate - it's a gaming/reward layer that:
- Reads on-chain data from the contract
- Tracks who deposited how much
- Calculates leaderboard rankings
- Prize pool paid from dev wallet (not from contract)

Think of it like a sports betting site - the game is separate from the scoreboard tracking it!

---

### Does this affect my yields?

**No.** Everything works exactly the same:
- Your deposits continue earning 0.7% daily
- Your referral commissions are unchanged
- Your rank bonuses still apply
- The contract is immutable

The contest is simply **additional** rewards on top of your normal earnings!

---

### Where do the prizes come from?

Prizes come from the **team's marketing budget**, not from:
- Protocol reserves
- User funds
- Future yield payments

The team has institutional funding and generates revenue from the 5% fee on deposits/compounds. Contest prizes are a standard marketing investment to reward top performers.

---

### Can the contract be changed?

**No, it's technically impossible.** The contract ownership is renounced to:

```
0x0000000000000000000000000000000000000000
```

This means:
- ❌ No one can call admin functions
- ❌ No one can upgrade the contract
- ❌ No one can change any parameters
- ❌ No one can pause or stop it

Verify yourself on [BSCScan](https://bscscan.com/address/0x69077f02A721d2EC2548DAeA35d96B5481165Dd0#readProxyContract) - check the `owner()` function.

---

### Is this a red flag?

No - this is standard industry practice:
- Every company rewards top performers
- Sales teams get bonuses at normal companies
- All network marketing runs contests
- Coinbase, Binance, etc. all run similar promotions

This is how well-funded projects show appreciation to their community builders.

---

### What if I'm skeptical?

We respect healthy skepticism! Here's what you can verify:

1. **Contract ownership** - Check `owner()` on BSCScan = 0x000...
2. **CertiK Audit** - [skynet.certik.com/projects/imp-money](https://skynet.certik.com/projects/imp-money)
3. **UK Company** - Companies House #16926268
4. **Start small** - Test with minimum $10 deposit
5. **Watch your yields** - See it working yourself

The blockchain doesn't lie - verify everything!

---

### How do I maximize my chances?

1. **Share your referral link** - More referrals = higher score
2. **Target quality over quantity** - Users who deposit more help your rank
3. **Stay active** - Engage your network throughout the month
4. **Track daily** - Monitor leaderboard and adjust strategy
5. **Use all channels** - Telegram, WhatsApp, social media

---
