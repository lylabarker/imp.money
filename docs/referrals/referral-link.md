4. You receive commission instantly

## Link Tracking

On your Network page, you can see:
- Number of direct referrals (L1)
- Total network size

## FAQ

### Do I need to deposit to refer?
Yes, you need at least one active deposit to be eligible for referral commissions.

### Can I change my referrer?
No, once you deposit with a referrer, that relationship is permanent.

### What if someone deposits without a referral link?
They'll be assigned to the protocol's default referrer. You can't claim them retroactively.

### Can I refer myself with another wallet?
Technically possible, but you'd need deposits in both wallets to earn, making it inefficient.
