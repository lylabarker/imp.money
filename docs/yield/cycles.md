# 21-Day Cycles

IMP Money operates on 21-day deposit cycles. This page explains how cycles work.

## The Cycle Model

Each deposit creates a new cycle:

```
Day 0:  Deposit $1,000
Day 1-20: Earning 0.7% daily, capital locked
Day 21+: Can withdraw or continue earning
```

## During the Cycle (Days 1-20)

### What's Locked?
- ✅ Your original deposit (principal)

### What's Available?
- ✅ Daily profits (claimable anytime)
- ✅ Referral commissions (paid instantly)
- ✅ Additional deposits (creates new cycle)

## After the Cycle (Day 21+)

### Full Control
- Withdraw everything
- Withdraw partially
- Leave and keep earning
- Add more deposits

### No Action Required
If you don't withdraw, your capital continues earning 0.7% daily indefinitely.

## Multiple Cycles

You can have multiple deposits, each on its own cycle:

| Deposit | Amount | Started | Unlocks |
|---------|--------|---------|---------|
| #1 | $500 | Dec 1 | Dec 22 |
| #2 | $300 | Dec 10 | Dec 31 |
| #3 | $1,000 | Dec 15 | Jan 5 |

Each unlock independently.

## Cycle Math

### Single Cycle (21 Days)
| Deposit | Daily ROI | Total ROI | Return |
|---------|-----------|-----------|--------|
| $100 | $0.70 | $14.70 | 14.7% |
| $1,000 | $7.00 | $147 | 14.7% |
| $10,000 | $70 | $1,470 | 14.7% |

### Multiple Cycles (1 Year = ~17 Cycles)
| Deposit | Per Cycle | 17 Cycles | Return |
|---------|-----------|-----------|--------|
| $100 | $14.70 | $250 | 250% |
| $1,000 | $147 | $2,499 | 250% |
| $10,000 | $1,470 | $24,990 | 250% |

### With Compounding (Reinvest Each Cycle)
| Start | After 17 Cycles | Return |
|-------|-----------------|--------|
| $100 | $943 | 843% |
| $1,000 | $9,430 | 843% |
| $10,000 | $94,300 | 843% |
